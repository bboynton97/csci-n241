      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><b>Cyberdine Systems</b> founded in 1992 initially as a small computer parts company at 18144 El Camino Real, Sunnyvale, California. In 1995, we made a break through discovery (almost as if some guy from the future gave us the information) and became one of the first commercial research groups to use neural network technology in robotics to create true artificial intelligence. After transitioning to robotic AI, the US military became interested in our technology and Cyberdine Systems became a defence contractor.</p>
