  <h1>Final Project Plan</h1>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>
    The website is a political campaign website for Ron Droumpf, the Gromflamite nominee running for the office of the President of the <a href="http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation">Galatic Federation</a>. He is running against Comander Rick from dimension C-99. The purpose of the site is to encourage supporters of Ron Droumpf and attempt to convert Commander Rick's voters to consider Droumpf. The website will be similar to past presidential campaign websites but have more rickandmorty-esque content. The styling and content should be similar enough to past campaigns that the skills learned could translate to a proper campaign easily.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Needs:</h3>
  <p>
    The site will have a page discussing Droumpf's past career and successes. This page will likely use an `ol` for listing his resume. It will also feature a page for his political platform, using a table to organize it effectively. A page on how to help campaign will also be found, and another page with a fake donation form. Lastly, the home page will feature updates (in an `article` format) about the campaign and general information.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Goals:</h3>
  <p>
    The goal of the site is to encourage supporters of Droumpf, solicit donations, promote his platform and lead to an electoral victory. The goal of the project is to have a fun, cool-looking website promoting a fictional campaign in the Rick and Morty universe.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Audience:</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Primary</b>
    <br>
    The primary audience will be those already in support of Droumpf and his campaign. The site will be a rallying point for those supports, to encourage campaigning and seek donations.
    <br>
    <b>Secondary</b>
    <br>
    The secondary audience will be those undecided or in support of Commander Rick. The goal with this audience will be to educate and share the Droumpf platform. Ultimately, this audience will be encouraged to consider voting for Droumpf.

  <h3>Competition:</h3>
  <p>
    The direct competition for this site would be Commander Rick's website. However, Commander Rick does not have a website since I'm making all this up, so we're just going to compare it to <a href="http://2004.georgewbush.org/index.asp">George W Bush's website</a> from 2004. This website has about the same level of html quality as is expected in this course, so it will be a good comparison. This website has a lot of content and pictures and (albeit outdated) attracts the eye.
