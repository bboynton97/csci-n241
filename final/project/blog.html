      <h3>Rick's Realization</h3>
      <label><i>May 6th, 2019</i></label>
      <br>
      <p>
        As the campaign ship flew across the multiverse, Rick has made numerous pit stops at local bars, libraries, and other places that look good to visit during a campaign. At each location, crowds were very diverse. From the rich, flying in on jet shoes so they don't need to walk, to the poor, crawling underneath the jet shoes so they don't get burnt. From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIcsk2ZoaTY">ringed nipples to the cone nipples</a>. From the schloombarks to the kneebs. All visited Rick's campaign events. One day, looking at the diverse crowd gathered to support him, Rick uttered in realization, "I am superior to everyone here."

      <h3>Rick went missing</h3>
      <label><i>April 22nd, 2019</i></label>

      <p>
        Today was a bad day for the campaign... Rick got drunk last night and started yelling about the <a href="https://youtu.be/U661zM733BM">Isreal-Palistine conflict</a>. When we woke up and looked for Rick, he was gone. Search teams were sent our and private investigators were hired, all to no avail. Eventually he portal gunned back to the campaign ship and won't tell us where he went. We are all worried... More info to come soon.

      <h3>First day on the campaign trail</h3>
      <label><i>April 12th, 2019</i></label>
      <br>
      <p>
        Today is the first day on the road / in the sky / in space! Rick has elected to travel by space ship instead of portal gun to seem more relatable to the constituents. We're having a hard time keeping him away from alcohol, but we're encouraging him to be at his best for the next few months until he has control over the multiverse, then he can be the drunk he is. We also found some other narcotics in his room on the ship that we had to dispose of. Should we be writing this on our campaign blog? Eh. Oh well.
