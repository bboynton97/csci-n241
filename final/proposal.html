  <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>For my final project, I am going to build a political campaign website for Ron Droumpf, the Gromflamite nominee running for the office of the President of the <a href="http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Federation">Galatic Federation</a>. He is running against Comander Rick from dimension C-99. Right now you're either thinking I am a total nut or, "OMG! I love Rick and Morty!!". Let's hope it's the latter. <br><br>I wanted to build a political campaign website, but I didn't want to actually be political. Since Rick and Morty is a great show, I figured I could come up with some made up political arguments and use the Rick and Morty universe as a setting.<br><br>I've seen Rick and Morty too many times and I enjoy politics, so hopefully I can have some fun with this. Other than that, there's not a whole lot of background knowledge neccisary.<br><br>My intended audience will be to encourage supporters of Ron Droumpf and attempt to convert Commander Rick's voters to consider Droumpf. In actuality, my audience are fans of Rick and Morty who might enjoy seeing a madeup political run by two fictional charecters.</p>
