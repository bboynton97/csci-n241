  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    Website documentation, test and validation results.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>
        Validated on W3 for HTML and CSS. No errors.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        Screen expands and contracts appropriately with viewport size change.
        Font sizes bare no burden.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>
        Average of 1.789s load time using a Chrome browser on an iOS device in Dulles, VA.
        The image took the longest to load which is expected.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        All text is easily viewable. Text only browsers are weird, but should have no problem with this html. The image alt values are appropriate.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Browser Independence</h3>
      <p>
        Tested on Firefox, Safari and Chrome. No problems or changes on these browsers. Printed version doesn't look fantastic, but is still comprehendable and acceptable.
      </p>
