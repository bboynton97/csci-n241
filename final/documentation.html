    Website documentation, test and validation results.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>
        Validated on W3 for HTML and CSS. No errors.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        Screen expands and contracts appropriately with viewport size change.
        Font sizes bare no burden.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Speed</h3>
      <p>
        Average of 1.789s load time using a Chrome browser on an iOS device in Dulles, VA.
        The image took the longest to load which is expected.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        All text is easily viewable. Text only browsers are weird, but should have no problem with this html. The image alt values are appropriate. Site was attempted on Cynthia Says and Accessibility Valey on multiple days, but both services appear to be down.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Browser Independence</h3>
      <p>
        Tested on Firefox, Safari and Chrome. No problems or changes on these browsers. Printed version doesn't look fantastic, but is still comprehendable and acceptable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li><h3>Best Viewed Assumptions</h3>
      <p>
        This site was built on both a 2015 15" MacBook Pro (OSX High Sierra) and a developer machine running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The site was primarily built in Firefox Quantum, but also tested on Safari and Chrome. It should function and display well on most modern machines and browsers.

    <li><h3>Post-project Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        I actually really enjoyed building this site. From writing the content, to building the HTML, learning how to use the Boostrap system, and adding a JS plug-in, it was pretty fun! I definitely learned some about jQuery in order to get the plugin to work, and that was cool. The site wasn't too difficult to plan and design, but I learned how much of a gap there can be between planning and implementing. I also learned a bit about organizing files properly and setting up the project for a static website. <br><br> The biggest hangups that I ran into were in the planning phase. After having completed so many projects throughout the year, building the site from the plans was pretty straightforward and simple. The biggest issue I had was when I accidently typed <code>formset</code> instead of <code>fieldset</code> and couldn't for the life of me figure out why it wasn't working.<br><br> All-in-all this project, and ultimately the class, was a lot of fun and very educational! I really enjoyed working through the projects and making them my own. Natalie did a great job at making me feel like I was engaged, even though it's an online class.
